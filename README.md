<h1 align="center">Advanced Programming Class
(Exercises and Projects)📚</h1>

A repository to provide *advanced programming class* exercises and projects to TAs. 📝
Also a good resource to keep and remember my interesting and useful codes during the second semester. 📦

 > 📑 Notes: 
 >  * These codes may have problems and errors, but I think they were enough to do the exercises and get a full score.🎓
 >  * There are questions related to each section in the form of a PDF file in the same section. (**sX_ap_all_Q.pdf**)
 >  * The questions of the final exam were not accessible to me, but by looking at their codes, you can understand things.
 >  * Files named *testro.py* were used to test the program and some codes while writing the exercises, and they are actually a type of *draft*.
